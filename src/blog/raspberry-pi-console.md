# Creating a Handheld Raspberry Pi Game Console!

I saw [this video](https://youtu.be/gkook0l_gsM?si=fsdA7Q1g7W_K_Jtw) on youtube a while ago and thought it was a really cool idea, so I made my own (much worse) version of it with a Raspberry Pi 4 I had. here's how I did it:

## Overview

## Case
first I inserted a display cable into the Raspberry Pi. then I put on a stacking case to provide a surface for the screen and game controller to attach onto the Raspberry Pi.

## Display

I inserted the ribbon cable into the display and attached the display to the Raspberry Pi. then I wrapped rubber bands around the edges of the Raspberry Pi and display to secure them together.

## Controller

I bought [this](https://a.co/d/6E9YDAr) controller clip for the xbox controller. I attached the clip to the controller.

## Power Bank

at this point, I can attach the Raspberry Pi to the clip and be done, but there is no way to take this around without it always being plugged in, so it is not very functional.

I had a spare power bank laying around that I used. I took 2 rubber bands and wrapped them around the power bank and the clip for the xbox controller.

then I took 2 more rubber bands and wrapped them around the power bank and the Raspberry Pi.

once the power bank was secured, I plugged the power bank into my Raspberry Pi power input, and then I also plugged in my xbox controller.

## OS

once all of that was done, I installed the OS using the app *Raspberry Pi Imager*.

I chose [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) for the OS and downloaded the build for my Raspberry Pi, then installed it to a micro SD card.

once I put it into the Raspberry Pi, I was done!
